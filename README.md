## PHYS 389 Computer Modelling Project

This repository contains all code developed for the PHYS 389 Computer Modelling Project at Lancaster University. The course involves a further development of scientific modelling skills in Python, through the implementation and analysis of computational techniques in a selected physical system. A core focus is on thorough testing of software to ensure its robustness, combined with careful planning and design of an open-ended project.

More specifically, the overall project goals include:
- Extending understanding of object-oriented programming, including the use of inheritance, abstract classes and composition
- Introducing advanced data visualisation and analysis techniques
- Developing the use of numerical algorithms for modelling physical systems
- Introducing code development infrastructure, including code repositories _(!)_, testing and debugging

To add:
- [ ] An outline of my chosen physical system 
- [ ] 'Prerequisites, installation & usage' sections
- [ ] 'Built with' section (once you know which packages you are using)
- [ ] 'Contribution' section

Might remove overall project goals section if README gets too lengthy.
