## PHYS 389 Computer Modelling Project

This repository contains all code developed for the PHYS 389 Computer Modelling Project at Lancaster University. The course involves a further development of scientific modelling skills in Python, through the implementation of numerical algorithms in a selected physical system. A core focus is on thorough testing and debugging of software to ensure its robustness, combined with careful planning and design of an open-ended project. An understanding of OOP will be extended (inheritance, composition, abstract classes), and advanced data visualisation and analysis techniques will be explored. 

I have chosen to model 2D diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA), a process involving the aggregation, or clustering, of particles undergoing Brownian motion. When such particles are allowed to adhere to a seed point, clusters (Brownian trees) are formed with distinct tree-like shapes. This is a demonstration of fractal geometry at play in the natural world, finding many practical applications from electrochemical deposition to snowflake formation.
